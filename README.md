# Rahul's Birthday Manifestation Quest

A tiny interactive HTML page where Rahul (in chibi form) walks through a soft pastel world, 
collects manifestation milestones, and then talks to Krishna. There is background music, 
a glowing Krishna aura, and a birthday popup with fireworks.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
2. Use the ◀ ▶ arrow keys to move Rahul left and right.
3. Walk into the glowing tiles to collect blessings.
4. After collecting all blessings, walk to Krishna on the right to see the special messages.

## Assets

- `assets/rahul-chibi.png` – Chibi Rahul
- `assets/krishna-chibi.png` – Chibi Krishna
- `assets/bg-music.mp3` – **Not included** (add your own soft instrumental file here)

To add music, drop any `.mp3` file into `assets/` and rename it to `bg-music.mp3`.

## GitHub Usage

You can push this folder to a GitHub repository. For GitHub Pages, you can:
- Put these files at the root of the `main` branch and enable Pages, or
- Put them in a `/docs` folder and point GitHub Pages to that folder.
